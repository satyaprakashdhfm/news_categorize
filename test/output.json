          "raw_content": "The one photo that 'will hurt Donald Trump'\nIn recent days, 26 leading political figures travelled to China to watch a military parade, but it's been claimed a photo from an earlier summit could \"hurt Trump's huge ego\"\n\nA photo from a recent Chinese summit could prove to be a \"significant historical moment\" but also \"hurt Trump's huge ego\", it has been claimed. In recent days, 26 leading political figures travelled to Beijing to witness a show of force as China's President Xi Jinping held a military parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.\nIn an event that also marked the end of Japanese aggression in China during the war, notable figures in attendance included the elusive Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nIn a series of attention-grabbing images, Putin, whose country is under Western sanctions due to its ongoing war in Ukraine, could be seen rubbing shoulders with the hermit kingdom's ruler and the US' economic rival, Xi.\nYet, one commentator writes that for US President Donald Trump, who is well aware of the power of a \"Kodak moment\", an image that surfaced at a summit in Tianjin could be the one that will hurt his \"huge ego.\"\n\nJames Ball, political editor at The New World, wrote in the i Paper: \"This week, there was finally a shot that might become a genuinely significant historical moment, so it must be all the more galling to Trump that he is not in it.\n\"Instead, the photo shows the leaders of Russia, China and India - Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Narendra Modi - sharing a warm three-way handshake.\n\"The moment, at a summit in the Chinese city of Tianjin, was clearly carefully stage-managed but the signal could not be clearer: there is a new alliance here, and neither America nor Europe is in it.\"\nJames also spoke of a \"bitter irony\", claiming that it may have been Trump who united these political giants. He writes that Trump's controversial tariff policy (including his attempts to launch a trade war with China) has ultimately resulted in nations needing \"more reliable\" partners.\nHe notes that Trump's seemingly hot-cold approach to Russia has encouraged China to interact with the nation \"more openly\", and claimed that he's offended India in two distinct ways, having \"cosied\" up to Pakistan and launched sanctions on India over its purchase of Russian oil.\n\nIt seems that these proceedings didn't escape the attention of Trump, who accused Xi of conspiring with Putin and Kim, making his feelings known in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.\nHe wrote: \"Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un as you conspire against the United States of America.\"\nDespite these comments, Trump has previously refuted notions that the seemingly warm relations between the rival nations signal a problem for the US globally.\nSpeaking to the BBC, which asked Trump if he thought China and other nations were creating a coalition in opposition to the US, he said: \"No. Not at all. China needs us.\"\nHe added that he had a \"very good relationship\" with Xi, but insisted that China needed the US \"much more\" than it needed them, noting that he didn't \"see that at all\".\n\nAt  Reach and across our entities  we and our partners use information collected through cookies and other identifiers from your device to improve experience on our site, analyse how it is used and to show personalised advertising.

          "raw_content": "The Great Divide: Pay parity remains complex for India's festive workforce\nThe investment required for each festive hire is significant. Experts estimate that fully loaded costs, including payouts, training, and hiring expenses, can range from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000 per month in high-demand industries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAs India gears up for its busiest shopping and festival season, the demand for temporary and gig workers is surging across retail, e-commerce, logistics, and consumer goods. To keep pace with skyrocketing orders and rising consumer footfall, companies are enhancing compensation structures, experimenting with incentives, and expanding their hiring footprint into Tier-II and Tier-III cities.\nIncentives on the rise\nSonal Arora, Country Manager, GI Group Holding, notes that companies, particularly in retail and last-mile delivery, are offering incentives beyond base pay. “To attract talent during the festive season and improve employee retention, companies are enhancing compensation packages. These include completion bonuses for staying through the season, attendance incentives to encourage regular shifts, and performance-linked bonuses tied to sales or customer satisfaction,” she says. Such perks are no longer optional but “essential in ensuring workforce availability and reducing attrition.”\nEchoing this, Shailesh Khanna, Brand Lead-Manpower at ManpowerGroup India, highlights a sharp year-on-year jump. “Incentives have risen 15 to 18 percent compared to 2024, especially in logistics and delivery roles, designed to minimize dropouts and provide attractive short-term work,” he explains.\nNitin Dave, CEO of Quess Staffing Solutions, points out that this year’s festive hiring in retail is steady and almost at par with last year. Traditional sectors like logistics have followed a similar trend. “The standout performers are BFSI and Manufacturing. Manufacturing, particularly in electronics and AV manufacturing, has seen hiring up by 15 to 20 percent as companies gear up for festive demand. Quick commerce is showing a promising growth of around 20 percent,” he says.\nTemporary vs permanent pay\nThe question of pay parity between temporary hires and permanent employees remains complex. Arora stresses that, legally, festive-season temps receive the same base pay as permanent employees in equivalent roles. “This is not only a legal requirement but also a necessity to attract quality talent in a highly competitive market,” she says, though she adds this parity does not apply to gig or freelance workers, whose earnings are task-based.\nKhanna, however, points to persistent inequalities across industries despite constitutional backing for equal pay. “In the manufacturing sector, contract workers often earn far less than permanent staff. In textiles and garments, the differences are stark, with permanent workers sometimes earning double or more compared to contract workers. In the automobile sector, contract workers earned as little as 41 to 51 percent of permanent worker compensation, even when performing the same duties,” he notes.\nSanjeeta Mohta, Workplace Culture Expert at Learning Spiral, offers a middle ground. “Contract laborers, in general, make less in aggregate because they typically do not receive indefinite benefits like PF, medical, and paid time-off. But during peak festive demand, the difference narrows because companies will sometimes raise hourly or daily rates to attract temps,” she says.\nDave observes a similar trend in incentives. “There has been only a marginal increase in fixed pay, with some e-commerce players raising salaries by about 500 to 1,000 rupees. But the real shift is in the variable component, where performance-linked earnings can add 40 to 50 percent to the base salary, making these roles quite attractive during the season.”\nMetro vs non-metro markets\nHiring patterns also vary widely across geographies. Arora underlines that wages are higher in metros due to cost-of-living differences and concentrated demand. “Even though businesses are now hiring more in Tier-II and Tier-III cities, metros and Tier-I cities still see higher demand for workers. As a result, salaries and salary increases remain higher in metro areas,” she says.\nKhanna agrees that wage trends are uneven but stresses that value for money differs too. “Salary levels in Tier-2 cities are growing. A few metro cities like Hyderabad and Ahmedabad offer lower salaries, but there is a better balance between pay and cost of living compared to Mumbai or Delhi,” he explains.\nMohta observes a similar divide: “Metro markets offer higher pay as compared to non-metro markets, where the cost of living is lower. In non-metro markets, wages spike during the festival season but remain below metro benchmarks.”\nAccording to Dave, the top eight to ten cities and major metros continue to dominate festive hiring. “Retail is seeing traction in Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities across the west and south, with retailers expected to bring in additional staff exclusively for weekends. E-commerce hiring demand is highest in NCR, Mumbai/Bhiwandi, and Bengaluru-Hyderabad. For manufacturing, industrial hubs like Hosur, Sanand, and the Pune belt remain strong hiring hotspots,” he says.\nGig worker pay surges\nOne segment seeing dramatic changes is gig work. Khanna emphasizes that escalating demand in quick commerce and logistics has driven pay upward. “Base pay has increased 9 to 10 percent. There has been a 50 percent hiring spike in quick commerce, alongside strong metro payouts and performance-based incentives,” he says.\nMohta adds that payouts are closely tied to productivity. “The payouts are based on the number of deliveries, with high incentives during the festival season. Some companies even offer allowances or regional bonuses,” she notes.\nThe cost of festive hiring\nThe investment required for each festive hire is significant. Arora estimates that fully loaded costs, including payouts, training, and hiring expenses, can range from INR 20,000 to INR 50,000 per month in high-demand industries.\nMohta pegs short-term costs slightly lower, noting, “Retention bonuses in big industries range between INR 8,000 and INR 15,000 per hire, depending on the sector. Hiring costs, training, uniforms, and short-term incentives are included in this.”\nDave provides a more granular breakdown: “On average, for a simple hire-and-deploy model, the cost is around 2,200 to 2,500 rupees per person. But if it involves hire, train, and deploy, the cost can go up to 5,000 to 6,000 rupees.”\nPost-season tapering\nOnce the lights dim and festive sales slow down, so do the incentives. Arora stresses that variable components are usually cut back. “Completion bonuses, attendance incentives, and similar payouts are typically reduced, or even discontinued, once the festive season ends,” she says.\nKhanna concurs: “Compensation levels for festive roles are elevated during the peak season to meet increased demand, but they generally taper off quickly once the season ends, aligning with the reduced need for temporary labor.”\nDave adds that companies are sticking to short-term manpower planning. “It is still largely last-minute hiring. Most companies start 60 days before Diwali and continue until the penultimate week. Businesses today prefer not to carry extra manpower inventory before real demand kicks in. The focus is on lean, agile hiring that responds to actual market needs,” he explains.\nIndia’s festive hiring boom is characterized by rising incentives, widening reliance on gig workers, uneven wage trends across regions, and the familiar cycle of inflated short-term pay tapering down post-season. While legal protections exist, pay parity for contract workers remains uneven across industries. And as consumer demand continues to climb, the pressure on companies to balance short-term costs with long-term workforce strategies only intensifies.\nRead More:India’s festive season to generate over 2.16 lakh jobs in 2025: Report\nRead More:Ahead of festive rush, Amazon India adds over 150,000 seasonal roles\nMore from Storyboard18\nBrand Makers\nAnand Mahindra urges ‘more reforms’ after GST overhaul; says 'faster reforms are surest way....'\n\nBrand Marketing\nIndia’s water purifier market jumps 32% during monsoon as health concerns rise: Report\n\nDigital\nEU delays Google Adtech fine amid US trade negotiations\n\nBrand Marketing\nCyber-attack halts Jaguar Land Rover production despite £800m digital overhaul\n\nBrand Marketing\nFestive confectionery ad spends surge 10–25% as brands bet big on rural revival, digital push and emotional storytelling\nGaming\nGovernment tightens noose on Real Money Gaming with PROGA and 40% GST hike\n\nDigital\nApple’s four senior AI researchers quit, defect to Meta, OpenAI and Anthropic\n\nAdvertising\nGST rate cuts to drive 12% rise in AdEx; FMCG, Auto sectors to lead spending surge\n\nDigital\nGoogle ordered to pay $425 million in landmark U.S. privacy lawsuit\nHow it Works\nThe Great Divide: Pay parity remains complex for India's festive workforce\n\nAgency News\nHavas India launches global business and digital transformation consultancy Gate One\n\nAdvertising\nHow Airtel’s “Live Every Moment” campaign strengthened top-of-mind recall among consumers\n\nHow it Works\nGST on ACs, cement, TVs, and cars reduced; tobacco and aerated drinks face 40% levy\nHow it Works\nTechie's response to recruiter's 'warrior' jargon goes viral: The Elon Musk-y twist to a salary query\n\nBrand Makers\n'No succession talks, no new CEO plans': BigBasket’s Hari Menon rejects leadership change speculation\n\nTelevision\nIndia’s Internet users cross 100 crore in June quarter; Pay DTH loses 9 lakh subscribers\n\nBrand Marketing\nSwiggy hikes platform fee to Rs 15 as festive demand surges\nHow it Works\n“Dessert mixed with pharmacy-grade caffeine”: Himatsingka slams Sting, Red Bull, Monster\n\nBrand Makers\nKartik Aaryan buys Rs 2 cr land in Alibaug, joins Amitabh Bachchan and Kriti Sanon as neighbours\n\nHow it Works\nIndia’s ad market grows; TV up 27%, Print 26% in H1 2025: Excellent Publicity\n\nDigital\nDoT blocks over 2 crore fraudulent phone connections, cuts spoof calls by 97%\nDigital\nApple’s iPhone 17 Air poised to be first global e-sIM-only device\n\nBrand Makers\nAdobe appoints Ben Goodman as APAC President to lead its Asia Pacific business\n\nBrand Marketing\nYouTube cracks down on Premium family plan sharing across different homes\n\nHow it Works\nHistoric Nehru bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi sold for record ₹1,100 Crore\nBrand Makers\nSuryakumar Yadav becomes first brand ambassador of Skyscanner\n\nBrand Makers\nDigitas India's CEO Unny Radhakrishnan to step down\n\nAdvertising\nVishal Mega Mart tightens ad budget to Rs 26 crore in FY25, posts 37% rise in profit\n\nBrand Makers\n'Nothing in life prepares you for heartbreak': Virat Kohli reflects on RCB victory stampede\nAdvertising\n106 mn sq ft realty development potential around stations: CBRE\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nRELATED STORIES\nThe Great Divide: Pay parity remains complex for India's festive workforce\nTechie's response to recruiter's 'warrior' jargon goes viral: The Elon Musk-y twist to a salary query\nKartik Aaryan buys Rs 2 cr land in Alibaug, joins Amitabh Bachchan and Kriti Sanon as neighbours\nShilpa Shetty's Bandra restaurant Bastian to shut operations amid Rs 60 crore fraud row\nGurugram Rains: Corporate employees rent Porter truck after Ola, Uber, Rapido shortage\n23-year-old Indian-origin engineer lands Rs 3.5 crore job at Meta.

This needs to change\nSocieties can be united and inspired by ideas of the future. We urgently need more of them, argues futurist Sarah Housley\nBy Sarah Housley\n3 September 2025\n\nSimone Rotella\n\nSimone Rotella\nThe 20th century was a famously fertile time for visions of the future, but the 21st century has failed to inspire them in the same way. Science fiction writer William Gibson, author of the prescient cyberpunk novel Neuromancer , has called this “future fatigue”, pointing out that we barely ever make reference to the 22nd century.\nOne reason for this apparent stasis is that most of the ideas of the future that captured people’s imaginations in the 20th century have mutated since then. For example, plastic was billed as the material of the future. It has become an abundant material resource that is durable and versatile, just as its manufacturers promised. But as it turns out, these properties have made our use of plastic a major problem, for the environment and for our health.\nThe dominant images of the future that we are presented with at the moment all have long histories to them. They include space colonisation, dystopian artificial intelligence and a longing to bring back the past – but a past that never was. This makes sense given the climate anxiety and dread about the future felt by many people. The future has started to feel like it is closing off rather than opening out.\nJean-Louis Missika, a former deputy mayor of Paris, has written that “when the future is dark, people turn to an idealised past, a lost golden age. Nostalgia becomes a refuge against dangers, a cocoon against the announced declines.”\nAnother reason for our “stuck” images of the future is that social media feeds present users with endless images, all at once, from a wide mix of time periods. This encourages nostalgia and facilitates a constant remix of existing ideas.\nIt’s not that absolutely no new future visions have emerged this century – think of solarpunk, for instance, a movement based on climate hope that developed online in the 2000s on Tumblr and on blogs. But it is notable that no major, forward-looking future visions have taken root in our collective imagination since smartphones came to dominate our way of communicating.\nI think about the future for a living and it is my experience that cohesive visions of desirable futures can inspire people to bring about change. They act as motivators and imagination engines. We can use them to visualise the society we want and then commit to work towards that future. Civil rights movements have long understood this. Unifying visions of the future are also effectively used in architectural renderings, ads and TV shows; Star Trek has inspired technologists for decades.\nWe are living through a time of transition, as we move from fossil fuels to renewables. This can feel terrifying, but can also be galvanising. There are plenty of hotspots of innovation today: look at the rise of rooftop solar energy in Pakistan, where households and small businesses are energetically embarking on the shift to renewables, or the communities around the world participating in Transition Towns by rethinking how their local economies and cultures can work.\nBut we lack synthesis: future thinking that assembles these innovations together into cohesive visions, puts them in a social context and then scaffolds from the present into the future.\nIn my new book, I look at four future visions being developed today: more-than-human futures reimagines our relationship with nature; degrowth redesigns the role of the economy; solarpunk recharges cultural innovation; and the metaverse immerses us in vivid digital worlds.\nBut the future doesn’t stop with these – there should be many more visions emerging. We need to seed them, grow them and see what shape they take when we tell stories of the future once again.\nSarah Housley is the author of Designing Hope: Visions to shape our future\nTopics:\nAdvertisement\nSign up to our weekly newsletter\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.

IIT Madras professor Mitesh Khapra is featured in the list of 100 most influential people in AI of TIME magazine. The magazine has honoured Khapra immensely by acknowledging his work and saying that his research “reshape his nation's academic research” in AI.\nWhy is Mitesh Khapra honoured by TIME magazine?\nKhapra is an associate professor at IIT Madras in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is not a founder of any AI company, but his works and research are of immense importance in the AI world as they influence and impact the lives of IITians who aspire to innovate in the field of AI or those who work in the world's top AI companies.\nMitesh’s work focused on making AI accessible in Indian languages as the advanced technology is mostly restricted to English language. To accomplish this, Khapra co-founded AI4Bharat, a research lab at IIT Madras that works to build open-source tools and datasets to infuse Indian languages in AI. The AI4Bharat initiative is focused on advancing AI technology for Indian languages through open-source mediums.\nHow does AI4Bharat work?\nThe project collected speech data from several districts throughout India, gathering resources that enable AI systems to function much easier in local languages. Through this effort India's dependence on English-centric AI models have been drastically reduced. AI4Bharat has created massive opportunities for students and researchers who wish to or are working to address issues specific to India through AI.\nMitesh Khapra founded AI4Bharat in 2019 which has also contributed to the government's Bhashini mission, whose aim is to make digital services available in Indian languages using AI. According to Khapra, even if global tech companies work with these datasets to enable their models to work in Indian languages like Hindi or Marathi, the effort would also benefit the country. \nPOPULAR STORIES\n\n'Light at the end of tunnel', says Russia's Putin on potential peace talks\n\nSara Ali Khan swears by THIS simple golden drink for healthy gut\n\nDelhi: 11 new stations on the Aqua Line of Noida Metro - Learn about launch DATE\n\nDonald Trump claims India offered him a 'no tariff' deal, says, 'New Delhi...'\n\nApple opens its first store in Bengaluru: All you need to know\nMOST VIEWED\n\nBigg Boss 19 full list of contestants: Gaurav Khanna, Amaal Mallik, and more\n\nPlanning a trip?

It has become one of the cheapest ways to generate energy almost everywhere, and it is one of the best options for combatting climate change.\nYet it still has its detractors. US energy secretary Chris Wright has claimed solar couldn’t supply all the energy the world needs. This is wildly and embarrassingly wrong, as many have pointed out. In fact, in the long run, solar – including wind, which captures the sun’s energy through a different mechanism – is the only power source that can meet growing energy demand without frying the planet.\nRead more\nHow incredibly simple tech can supercharge the race to net zero\nRead more\nHow incredibly simple tech can supercharge the race to net zero\nOn 2 September, Wright posted on social media platform X: “Even if you wrapped the entire planet in a solar panel, you would only be producing 20% of global energy. One of the biggest mistakes politicians can make is equating the ELECTRICITY with ENERGY!”\nNow to start with, electricity is measured in terms of the energy it provides, so for practical purposes, yes you can equate electricity with energy.\nAs climate scientist Gavin Schmidt at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies pointed out on Bluesky, the energy content before use of all the fuels used worldwide in 2024 was 186,000 terawatt-hours. He said Earth receives 6000 times as much energy as that each year.\nFree newsletter\nSign up to The Earth Edition\nUnmissable news about our planet, delivered straight to your inbox each month.\n\nMoreover, Schmidt said, if you take into account the fact 60 per cent of fossil fuel energy is lost while converting it to useful power, then Earth receives 18,000 times as much energy from the sun as would be needed to meet the current energy consumption.\nOf course, existing solar panels capture only around 20 per cent of the sun’s energy, and you can’t put them everywhere. But a 2021 report by Carbon Tracker estimated that 0.3 per cent of the world’s land area – yes, just the land – would be needed to meet the current energy demand from solar alone, which is less than the current land footprint of fossil fuel infrastructure. In principle, solar and wind could supply more than 100 times the current global energy demand, according to the report.\nGiven meeting the current energy demand with fossil fuels is already causing disastrous global warming, it is fortunate there are not enough fossil fuels on the planet to supply 100 times as much energy. But what about nuclear fusion? Would that be an even better option than solar if it ever becomes viable?\nThe answer is no. Eric Chaisson at Harvard University estimated even assuming modest growth in global energy demand, in around three centuries the waste heat alone might be enough to warm the planet by 3°C. We are talking here about the waste heat produced as generated energy is used, when you boil a kettle or use a computer, say.\nWith solar – and wind, tidal and wave power, which are effectively a form of solar – waste heat is not an issue because that energy already ends up as waste heat, whether we use it or not. With other power sources such as nuclear fission, the waste heat is additional heat not already present.\nRead more\nBill McKibben makes a powerful pitch for solar in optimistic new book\nRead more\nBill McKibben makes a powerful pitch for solar in optimistic new book\n“[Carl] Sagan used to preach to me, and I now preach to my students, that any intelligent civilisation on any planet will eventually have to use the energy of its parent star, exclusively,” Chaisson told New Scientist in 2012.\nWhile three centuries is a long way off, waste heat is already significant regionally. Researchers have estimated summer maximum temperatures in Europe are 0.4°C higher because of waste heat. By 2100, annual average temperatures in some industrialised regions could be nearly 1°C higher because of waste heat – an effect not currently included in climate models.\nThe bottom line is not only can solar and wind supply all the energy we need for many centuries to come, they are the only technologies that can do so without causing catastrophic warming. Wright couldn’t be more wrong.\nTopics:\nAdvertisement\nSign up to our weekly newsletter\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox.

          "raw_content": "The flawed carbon math that lets major polluters off the hook\nHow flawed calculations let high-polluting countries off the hook, and how courts can hold them accountable.\n\nClimate action is falling behind on the goals as stated in the Paris Agreement. To meet those goals, countries must act according to their 'fair share' targets. However, researchers from Utrecht University found a bias in how ambition and fairness assessments were calculated until now: \"previous studies assessing countries climate ambition share a feature that rewards high emitters at the expense of the most vulnerable ones.\" This finding influences climate change mitigations globally. The research, led by Yann Robiou du Pont, was published on September 3 in Nature Communications.\nThe researchers argue that previous fairness and ambition assessments were biased, as they start from shifting goalposts of rising emissions. Their proposed method avoids delaying the obligation to reduce emissions and calculates the immediate ambition gap that can be filled by climate measures and international finance. As negotiated climate targets are still insufficient, this work underscores the growing role of courts in ensuring that climate and human rights obligations are met. The study highlights that high-emitting countries, most notably G7 countries, Russia, and China, need to do more given the very different historical responsibility and financial capability of countries.\nAn approach based on historical responsibility needed\nFair-share emissions allocations distribute the global carbon budget among countries based on principles like historical responsibility, capability, and development needs, aiming to assign each country a 'fair share' of allowable emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, these allocations indicate what each country should commit to in order to collectively limit global warming to 1.5°C and staying well below 2°C.\nBy calculating each ambition and fairness assessment from the present situation, we increasingly let major polluting countries off the hook. This pushes a heavier burden onto countries that have done the least to cause the crisis, or more realistically brings the world towards catastrophic levels of global warming. Therefore, the authors propose calculating fair-share emissions allocations immediately based on each country's historical contributions to climate change and their capacity to act. Accounting for immediate responsibilities sets a new baseline. It would cause some countries' emission paths to suddenly and drastically change instead of following a smooth decline. This approach would demand steep, immediate cuts mostly from wealthier, high-emitting countries. Since the cuts needed from these countries are too large to achieve locally, it requires substantial financial support for additional mitigation in poorer countries. Importantly, removing the systemic reward for inaction affects the ranking of countries' gap between their current pledges and fair emissions allocations, even within the group of high-income countries. Then, the USA, Australia, Canada, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have the greatest gap, requiring the most additional effort and finance. Much of equity discussions is about developed versus developing countries, but this paper is particularly relevant for developed countries being rewarded for inaction compared to other and more ambitious developed countries.\nRole in climate litigation\nFair-share studies like this one are increasingly used in climate litigation, such as the KlimaSeniorinnen case before the European Court of Human Rights. The court recognised that insufficient national climate action constitutes a breach of human rights and that countries must justify how their climate pledges are a fair and ambitious contribution to the global objectives. Courts rely on these assessments to evaluate whether national emissions targets are sufficient and equitable. Biases in the assessments therefore have real-world impact: they can shape legal rulings, influence policy commitments, and inform public opinions. Courts are thus emerging as a key force in ensuring accountability and indirectly promoting cooperation when political and diplomatic negotiations fall short. In a landmark advisory opinion issued on July 23, 2025, the International Court of Justice affirmed that countries have a legal obligation under international law to prevent significant harm to the climate system, emphasising the duty to act collectively and urgently. \"This strengthens and underscores the growing role of courts in enforcing climate justice,\" says Robiou du Pont.\nPaying the debt\nSolving the climate crisis is a moral imperative long identified by climate justice activists and scholars. Practically, we are observing that the lack of fair efforts by countries with the greatest capacity and responsibility to act and provide finance, results in insufficient action globally. A fairer allocation of effort is likely to results in more ambitious outcomes globally. This study explains how immediate climate efforts and finance are key to align with international agreements to limiting global warming.\nStory Source:\nMaterials provided by Utrecht University.

          "raw_content": "Trending News\n36\nNew Articles\n\nNew Articles\n\nEmail\n\nEmail\nFind Your Next Job !\n\nRelated Practices & Jurisdictions\n\nIn a cautionary “tail” about the importance of engaging in the interactive process, when a Maryland automobile dealership allegedly denied an Iraq War veteran’s request for a service dog to manage panic attacks from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit on his behalf. According to the EEOC’s May 21, 2025, lawsuit, Criswell Chevrolet, Inc. violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by denying an employee’s request for a service dog without ever engaging in the interactive process, essentially forcing the employee to quit. Approximately three months after the EEOC filed suit, the agency resolved the matter with Criswell via a consent decree that provided $30,000 for the former employee, mandated policy changes and training regarding the ADA and the interactive process, as well as two years of related monitoring via periodic compliance reporting to the EEOC.\nQuick Hits\nAs set forth in its complaint, the EEOC alleged that Daniel Pulsipher, a parts stock clerk, requested and was denied a service dog. Pulsipher, a Navy veteran, suffered from traumatic brain injury and PTSD, which manifested through panic attacks triggered by sudden noises, individuals approaching from behind, flashing lights, and crowded areas. Roughly five months into his role at Criswell, Pulsipher received notice that he had been approved for a service dog to assist in managing his conditions. According to the EEOC’s complaint, Pulsipher made two requests to have the dog present with him at work, first to a member of his management team and then directly to Human Resources.\nIn response, Criswell allegedly denied his request in less than twenty-four hours, without any discussion, interactive process, or offer of alternative accommodations. Shortly thereafter, Pulsipher left his job with Criswell, citing continued unmitigated exposure to triggers. Through the consent decree, Pulsipher will receive back pay in the amount of $1,260, plus $28,740 in noneconomic damages. For its part, Criswell now finds itself on a short leash for the next two years, having to conduct training, report compliance, and be subjected to monitoring by the EEOC.\nThe Accommodation Process for Animal-Based Requests\nMake no bones about it, accommodation requests for service animals or emotional support animals in the workplace are now fairly common after having been on the rise for years. While employers need not “roll over” on every such request, this case emphasizes the importance of recognizing their validity and putting such requests through a compliant, effective accommodation process, which necessarily includes robust interaction between the employer and the employee.\nCritical to that accommodation process is recognizing the distinction between service animals that have been trained to perform a specific task and emotional support animals, which have not, but whose presence can still constitute a reasonable accommodation, depending on the circumstances and whether their presence is supported by valid medical documentation.\nAdditional accommodation process considerations employers may want to keep in mind are:\nSit—Sitting down with the employee and inquiring into what limitations the employee has in performing the essential functions of the position and to better understand how the proposed accommodation would work.\nSpeak—Speaking, not only with the employee, but with necessary human resource or management personnel to determine whether a service animal is feasible in that particular position, and if not, whether other effective accommodations may be available for the employee.\nHeel—Walking through the accommodation process side by side with the employee to reach a resolution. Remember that the interactive process may require several rounds of discussion or clarifying medical information before establishing whether the accommodation or an alternate accommodation is effective and remains that way.\nFetch—Consider requiring the employee to obtain and return medical documentation, from a qualified provider, to validate the need for such an accommodation and/or to address whether other accommodations could be effective. Where a service animal is requested, it may also be reasonable to request the employee provide supporting documentation of the animal’s training and ability to provide the support at issue.\nStay—Staying vigilant and keeping in mind that when an accommodation is provided, it still warrants monitoring to make sure that it is still needed and continues to be effective and not unduly disruptive to the employer’s operations.\nNext Steps\nEmployers may want to consider reviewing their current accommodation process, especially as it applies to animal-based requests, and provide refresher training to supervisors, management, and human resources personnel about the importance of recognizing and relaying requests for accommodation to the appropriate party, following the employer’s reasonable accommodation process, and continuing to engage in the interactive process to its conclusion.\n|  |  |\n --- |\n|  |  |\nCurrent Public Notices\nCurrent Legal Analysis\nMore from Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart, P.C.\nUpcoming Events\n\nMore Upcoming Events\n\nSign Up for any (or all) of our 25+ Newsletters\n\nFooter Menu 1\nFooter Menu 2\nFooter Menu 3\nLegal Disclaimer\nYou are responsible for reading, understanding, and agreeing to the National Law Review's (NLR’s) and the National Law Forum LLC's  Terms of Use and Privacy Policy before using the National Law Review website.

          "raw_content": "PMFAI Seeks U.S. Tariff Exemptions for Medicinal, Veterinary and Public Health Pesticides\n03 September 2025, New Delhi:The Pesticides Manufacturers and Formulators Association of India (PMFAI) has voiced urgent concerns over the United States’ recent decision to impose a 50% tariff on agrochemical imports, warning that the move could severely impact Indian exporters and disrupt global supply chains in pharmaceuticals, veterinary care, food security, and public health.\nThe tariff hike stems from an order regulating imports under a “reciprocal tariff” framework aimed at addressing U.S. trade deficits. While pharmaceutical products have been granted exemptions, pharmaceutical-grade pesticides with proven medicinal and veterinary use have been excluded because they are classified under agrochemical HS codes.\nHighlighting the urgency of the matter, Mr. Pradip Dave, President of PMFAI, said “The U.S. tariff hike is not merely a trade barrier but a direct challenge to global health, veterinary care, and food security. India is a key supplier of critical agrochemicals, and timely policy intervention is essential to safeguard both domestic industry and international supply chains.”\nMedicinal and Veterinary Products at Stake\nPMFAI highlights that products such as Permethrin (listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia for human lice and scabies treatment) and Fipronil (an essential veterinary ectoparasiticide) deserve inclusion under the pharmaceutical exemption. The association argues that reclassification of such substances under HS Chapter 30 would better reflect their real-world applications and ensure continued availability in both human and veterinary health sectors.\nPublic Health Concerns\nPMFAI also calls for exemptions on WHO-recommended public health pesticides, which are critical for controlling malaria, dengue, and other vector-borne diseases. These include widely used molecules such as Permethrin, Deltamethrin, Alpha-cypermethrin, and Lambda-cyhalothrin—many of which are exported in significant volumes from India.\nThe association warns that tariff barriers on these products could jeopardize ongoing public health programs in malaria- and dengue-endemic regions, noting that India is one of the world’s largest suppliers of these life-saving vector control tools.\nFood Security-Critical Molecules at Risk\nIn addition to medicinal and public health products, PMFAI emphasizes that several agriculturally critical pesticides are also at stake. Molecules such as Mancozeb, Cypermethrin, 2,4-D, Chlorpyriphos, Diuron, Triclopyr, Lambda-Cyhalothrin, and Neem Seed Oil—not widely manufactured in the U.S.—have seen strong export volumes from India in recent years. The new tariff regime could disrupt U.S. food security supply chains that rely on these imports.\nPMFAI’s Appeal to Government\nTo safeguard Indian exports and global supply chains, PMFAI has urged the government to take urgent steps. The association has called for bilateral negotiations with the United States to secure tariff exemptions for pharmaceutical-grade, WHO-approved, and food security–critical pesticides. It has also emphasized the need for export rebates and enhancements under the RoDTEP scheme to help Indian exporters remain competitive in the face of higher tariff barriers. Additionally, PMFAI has recommended reclassification of medicinal-use pesticides under pharmaceutical and veterinary categories within the HS code system, aligning them with their real-world applications. The association further suggested that the government consider compensatory relief equivalent to the U.S. tariffs in order to protect domestic manufacturers and mitigate the impact on India’s agrochemical sector.\nA Global Challenge\nPMFAI stresses that the U.S. tariff hike is not only a trade issue but also a pharmaceutical, public health, and food security challenge. Restricting access to these essential products risks disrupting malaria control efforts, veterinary disease management, and food production worldwide.\nAlso Read: Maize Breeding Through Biotechnology Can Boost Yields by 10-15% in India, Says IIMR\n📢 If You’re in Agriculture, Make Sure the Right People Hear Your Story.From product launches to strategic announcements, Global Agricultureoffers unmatched visibility across international agri-business markets.

Head coach Dave Canales is now entering year two, and his first season showed signs of life late, with four of Carolina’s five wins coming in the back half of the schedule.\nThis fall, the Panthers catch a break with one of the league’s softest slates, particularly in the early going. Their first seven contests are against opponents carrying losing expectations, and they don’t square off with a projected winning team until Week 8. That stretch could give the roster valuable time to settle in, find a rhythm, and possibly stack some momentum.\nLISTEN:\nAll Carolina Panthers NFL games LIVE on SiriusXM\nLISTEN:\nAll Carolina Panthers NFL games LIVE on SiriusXM\nEven so, the defense has the tallest mountain to climb. In 2024, Carolina ranked dead last across nearly every major category — overall defense, passing defense, rushing defense, third-down stops, and red-zone efficiency. Now, the challenge grows steeper with a 2025 schedule stacked with high-powered offenses, making a turnaround a must if the Panthers want to keep pace.\nThe offense, meanwhile, features building blocks. The line up front is among the league’s strongest, the run game has the potential to churn out steady yards, and the wide receiver corps looks deeper than in years past.\nHere is everything you need to know in order to listen to Panthers games on the radio this season.\nPanthers radio station 2025\nYou can listen to every Panthers football game on WRFX 99.7 The FOX, the flagship station for the Panthers.

          "raw_content": "Reviews\nGaming\nAnime and Manga\nFollow IGN India\nMore\n\nDemon Slayer Infinity Castle’s 750-Screen Release Could Change How Anime Films Play in India\nWider access, regional dubs, and unprecedented demand are putting anime closer to the mainstream big screen.\n\nWhen Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle opened in Japan this July, fans lined up at midnight screenings to watch the film. The film’s run has already crossed $294.5 million at the global box office, making it one of the year’s biggest anime releases (this is before the film releases in North America – one of the biggest moneymakers for anime films). Now, the same energy is set to spill into India, as on September 5, the film will release across more than 750 screens nationwide, which is the widest release ever for an anime movie in the country.\nThat number is significant. Anime films here are usually treated as niche events, restricted to a handful of metropolitan multiplexes. Fans in smaller cities often have to travel hours, or miss out entirely, when a major title comes around. Infinity Castle looks like the film that breaks that pattern.\nFor years, anime movies in India had a frustrating ceiling. Even when juggernauts like Dragon Ball Super: Broly or Jujutsu Kaisen 0 pulled crowds, distributors were slow to expand beyond big-city releases. Demand was visible, of course, shows like Naruto, One Piece, and My Hero Academia already had huge online fanbases, but theatrical anime was treated like a side event rather than a mainstream draw.\nDemon Slayer: Infinity Castle Voice Actor Says Zenitsu Will Have a Bigger Role and Go to ‘Places Fans Never Imagined Possible’\nThat’s why 750 screens matter. It shows a shift in how distributors see anime’s commercial potential. Fans won’t need to worry about limited availability or travelling to a major city to catch Infinity Castle. If you’re in a Tier 2 or Tier 3 city, odds are you’ll finally have a nearby theatre screening the film.\nCrunchyroll and Sony Are Betting Big\nThe wide rollout comes courtesy of Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures Entertainment, and this move speaks volumes about their confidence. It’s basically a full-scale bet from them that Demon Slayer can draw crowds comparable to mainstream blockbusters.\nA post shared by Crunchyroll India (@crunchyroll_in)\nWhy the trust? For one, Demon Slayer is arguably the most popular modern shonen anime in India. Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke have become as recognisable to young Indian anime watchers as any Marvel superhero. The series’ emotional storytelling, breathtaking animation, and high-stakes battles has given it global appeal, and India is no exception.\nRegional Dubs Have Widened the Net\nAccessibility is another key factor. Infinity Castle won’t just be available in Japanese with English subtitles, but also in English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu dubs. Sure, this treatment is only given to major shonen releases, but over the past few years, regional dubs have exploded online, bringing shows like Demon Slayer to a much wider audience in India. Even I have grown up on watching anime like Naruto and Dragon Ball Z on Cartoon Network in Hindi, and here I am writing about anime full-time. So, dubs matter.\n\n© Koyoharu Gotoge / SHUEISHA, Aniplex, ufotable\nThe strategy could also draw in newer fans who might hesitate with subs but are open to anime in their own language. India is an extremely diverse market, so these extra options can make a decisive difference.\nWhy Infinity Castle Release Is Different\nInfinity Castle’s BookMyShow page already has almost 600,000 people marking interest to watch the film when it releases. That level of anticipation isn’t common for anime films in India. It’s not even common for household name-starrer Hollywood films. It suggests that anime is no longer a “niche” theatre experience here, and it’s become something that can fill multiplexes across the country.\nMore importantly, this release could set a precedent. If Infinity Castle performs well, other studios and distributors may feel encouraged to give anime films wider and more inclusive releases. That could mean a future where fans don’t have to wonder whether they’ll even get a screening in their city.\nAnime in India has grown through torrents, fan subs and dubs, TV broadcasts, and eventually streaming. The theatrical space has always been the hardest to break into. Infinity Castle’s rollout may be the moment when the industry is finally catching up with the community’s growth.\nThis release is going to be more than just another movie for fans who have long wished to support creators on the big screen. This is a sign that anime can stand shoulder to shoulder with mainstream cinema in India, and if Demon Slayer does what it’s expected to, it might just open the floodgates for everything that comes next.\nGot any news tips, or want to discuss a possible story?

          "raw_content": "New Jersey Democrat avoids House censure with help of five Republicans\n\nUpdated September 3, 2025 at 2:01 PM CDT\nFive Republicans voted with Democrats to stop a vote to censure Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., following her indictment earlier this year afteran altercation with law enforcement during a visit to an immigration facility.\nRepublican Reps. Don Bacon and Mike Flood of Nebraska, John Joyce of Pennsylvania, Mike Turner of Ohio and David Valdado of California voted with Democrats to prevent a vote to censure McIver and remove her from her spot on the House Homeland Security Committee.\nMcIver was indicted by a federal grand jury in June on criminal counts stemming from a visit to an immigration detention facility that resulted in a physical altercation with law enforcement. She pleaded not guilty.\nThat indictment listed three counts of \"assaulting, resisting, and interfering\" with federal officers, as McIver \"forcibly impeded\" officers as they attempted to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside the Delaney Hall Federal Immigration Facility in Newark, N.J., on May 9.\nMcIver says the Trump administration has \"weaponized the Department of Justice.\"\n\"At the end of the day, we went to Delaney Hall for an oversight visit because members of Congress had the right to hold these agencies accountable,\" McIver said in a statement at the time of her indictment. \"We did not go there to protest, we did not go there for any of that. We went there to make sure that this facility was up to par and the detainees there were getting due process.\"\nGOP-led censure resolution fails\nRep. Clay Higgins, R-La., introduced a privileged resolution in Julyto censure McIverand remove her from her from her assigned committee. The resolution advanced on Tuesday. House rules required a vote on the measure within two days.\nFor her part, McIver responded to the resolution by saying: \"If House Republicans think they can make me run scared, they're wrong.\"\n\"We were all elected to do the people's work. I take that responsibility seriously — Clay Higgins clearly does not,\" she said in a statement Tuesday. \"Instead of making life any better for the people he represents, he's seeking to punish me for doing what he and his caucus are too cowardly to do: conduct real oversight, stand up to this administration, and do our jobs.\"\nDemocrats in the House, who have accused the Department of Justice of charging McIver for political reasons, offered a measure on Wednesday to block the resolution from taking effect, an effort that succeeded due to the five GOP votes.\nIn a censure tit-for-tat, Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., introduced a resolution shortly ahead of the vote to censure GOP Rep. Cory Mills for his alleged assaults. That measure was not brought to a vote once the censure effort against McIver failed.\nThe House has censured 28 members in history; nearly 28% of those censures have occurred in the last four years.\nThe most recent member to be censured was Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, after he disrupted President Trump's first joint address to Congress in his second term.\nCopyright 2025 NPR\n\nSubscribe to the Daily Digest for bite-sized news from IPR and NPR, plus a bit of good news, delivered fresh to your inbox every weekday.",

Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Wednesday killed at least 31 people, according to local hospitals.\nIsraelis were taking part in nationwide demonstrations to protest the call-up of 60,000 reserves for the expanded operation, which has sparked global condemnation and left the country increasingly isolated.\nThe demonstrators accuse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of prolonging the fighting for political purposes instead of reaching a ceasefire deal with Hamas that would free hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the war.\n“We have to take an extreme action so that someone will remember. There’s no such thing as a state abandoning its citizens,” Yael Kuperman, a protester near the Knesset told Israeli public broadcaster Kan.\nA rare warning from the UAE\nThe UAE was the driving force behind the 2020 Abraham Accords brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which it and three other Arab countries forged ties with Israel. Trump has said he hopes to expand the accords in his second term, potentially to include regional power Saudi Arabia.\nAnwar Gargash, a senior Emirati diplomat, wrote on the social platform X that “annexation is a red line.”\nHe linked to a Times of Israel story that quoted Emirati diplomat Lana Nusseibeh as saying annexation would “severely undermine the vision and spirit of (Abraham) Accords, end the pursuit of regional integration and would alter the widely shared consensus on what the trajectory of this conflict should be — two states living side by side in peace, prosperity and security.”\nThe two diplomats did not specifically say that Abu Dhabi would withdraw from the agreement, and the Emirati Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions seeking clarification.\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories to form their future state. Israel’s current government is staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood and supports eventual annexation of much of the West Bank.\nThe Palestinians and much of the international community say that would prevent a two-state solution, which is widely seen internationally as the only way to resolve the decades-old conflict.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-member bloc of which the UAE is a member, separately came out Wednesday with its own statement calling proposals to annex the West Bank “dangerous.”\nPalestinians face more displacement as strikes continue\nIsraeli strikes on Gaza City killed at least 15 people, including two children and four women, according to Shifa Hospital and Al-Quds Hospital, where the bodies were taken. An additional 16 people were killed in southern Gaza, including 10 who were seeking humanitarian aid, according to Nasser Hospital.\nIsrael says it only targets militants and takes measures to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants operate in densely populated areas.\nIsrael says that Gaza City — the largest Palestinian city in either the besieged strip or the occupied West Bank — remains a Hamas stronghold above what military officials claim is a vast underground tunnel network, even after several major raids earlier in the war.\nIsrael has intensified air and ground assaults on the outskirts of Gaza City, particularly in western neighborhoods where people are being driven to flee toward the coast, according to humanitarian groups that coordinate assistance for the displaced.\nSite Management Cluster, one such group, said Wednesday that families were trapped by the prohibitively high cost of moving, logistical hurdles and a lack of places to go.\n“Palestinians are also reluctant to move due to the fear of not being able to return or exhaustion from repeated displacement,” it said.\nDeath toll mounts from war and hunger\nThe twin threats of combat and famine, Palestinians and aid workers say, are only growing more acute for families in Gaza City, many of whom have been displaced multiple times during the nearly two-year war.\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that five adults and one child died from malnutrition over the past day, bringing the total toll to 367, including 131 children throughout the war.\nThe ministry reported on Tuesday that a total of 63,633 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, including more than 2,300 seeking aid, since the start of the war. Part of the Hamas-run government but staffed by medical professionals, the ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says women and children make up around half of the dead.\nU.N. agencies and many independent experts consider the ministry’s figures to be the most reliable estimate of war casualties. Israel disputes them, but hasn’t provided its own toll.\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took 251 people hostage. Forty-eight are still being held in Gaza, around 20 of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were returned in ceasefires or other deals.\nIn a letter sent as members of Parliament returned to work in the United Kingdom, three non-governmental organizations highlighted how more than 3,700 Palestinians were killed over the body’s 34-day summer break.\nAmnesty International, Doctors Without Borders and Medical Aid for Palestinians accused Israel of genocide — a charge it has vehemently denied. The organizations demanded the British government take action, noting famine, a collapse of the health care system and the killing of Mariam Dagga, a visual journalist who had worked for The Associated Press and Doctors Without Borders.\n“This is not merely a humanitarian crisis — it is a full-blown and man-made human rights catastrophe,” the statement said. “Expressions of ‘deep concern’ are not enough.”\nShare this:\nRevContent Feed\nMost Popular\nEditorial: Chicago’s gunmen did not get Pritzker and Johnson’s memo\nThis Northwestern professor fled the US under Trump.
