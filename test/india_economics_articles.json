The economy grew 7.4% year over year[1](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-1)in the final quarter of fiscal year 2024 to 2025[2](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-2)—with 6.5% growth for the whole year—setting the stage for a more confident outlook for fiscal year 2025 to 2026.[3](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-3)\n\nEntering the new fiscal, India’s economic outlook is buoyed by three key engines: a resilient consumer base, a broadening investment landscape, and a digitally skilled, dynamic workforce. Urban spending is rising, private capital expenditures are showing green shoots, and India’s tech-adaptive talent is driving innovation and showcasing its global capabilities.\n\n[Read more from the collection ### Economics](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/research-centers/economics.html)\n\n![Image 14](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nThe August edition of India economic outlook explores these key drivers behind India’s resilient growth, and how it has performed compared to its peer nations. This edition also briefly touches upon the evolving dynamics of India’s trade positioning in the global economic landscape. Amid an evolving and uncertain trade landscape, India is laying the groundwork for deeper market access, stronger intellectual property protections, and expanded investment corridors. The pace at which India is working on these agreements suggests that these are not just trade instruments, but strategic levers that will amplify domestic growth drivers and open new growth frontiers for the country.\n\nAccounting for the resilience in economic fundamentals, easing inflation levels, and bold policy stimuli aligned for expansion this year, _Deloitte expects a baseline forecast of_ _6.4% to 6.7% GDP growth this fiscal year and stronger growth in the next fiscal year_.\n\n#### Table of Content\n\n*   [Resilience in economic fundamentals in the last quarter pushed growth for fiscal 2024 to 2025](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#resilience)\n*   [India is maintaining a steady lead over peer economies](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#India)\n*   [Indian capital markets are getting deeper, with strong returns on investment](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#capital-market)\n*   [India is opening new trade doors](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#trade-doors)\n*   [India’s near-term economic outlook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#economic-outlook)\n\n![Image 15](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nResilience in economic fundamentals in the last quarter pushed growth for fiscal year 2024 to 2025\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html)India’s GDP growth numbers for the last quarter of fiscal 2024 to 2025 came as a welcome surprise, with the economy growing at a brisk 7.4% year on year. Growth for the full fiscal year came in at 6.5%, driven by strong private consumption expenditure and investments, indicating domestic demand might be more resilient than expected, supported by easing inflation and favorable conditions in rural economies.\n\n*   **Private final consumption expenditure** grew 6% in the last quarter of fiscal year 2024 to 2025. Although consumption spending growth slowed this quarter, annual growth was 7.2%, which was well ahead of overall GDP growth.\n*   What came as a relief is that, after years of being led primarily by the government, green shoots were visible in private investment, suggesting broader participation in capex formation. **Gross fixed capital formation** rose by a strong 9.4% in the fourth quarter, up from an average of 6.2% in the last three quarters. However, full-year gross fixed capital formation growth was more modest at 6.7%; the fourth-quarter acceleration may suggest that private capex may have turned the corner, as consumption spending showed signs of improvement.\n*   The impact of global risks and trade headwinds led to a moderation**in exports** to 3.9% in the fourth quarter compared with an average 7.4% seen in the past three quarters. Nonetheless, exports for the full fiscal year grew at **6.3%**,an improvement compared with the 2.2% seen in fiscal year 2023 to 2024. Goods exports were affected more than services exports, and the latter helped India to reduce its annual current account balance to –0.6% of GDP—the lowest since fiscal 2016 to 2017 (except during the pandemic when the balance moved to a surplus).\n*   **Government capex**was relatively restrained in the fourth quarter, with revised estimates being 12.2% lower than the budgeted effective capex for the entire fiscal year. Government spending contracted for the quarter by 1.8%—the sharpest fall since the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to 2023, bringing down annual spending growth to just 2.3%.\n\nLast-quarter data for fiscal 2024 to2025 has not only boosted annual growth figures for the previous year but also set a positive trajectory, with notable improvements in key economic indicators, as India enters a new fiscal year.\n\n*   **Lower government spending**brought down the fiscal deficit to 4.8% of GDP in fiscal year 2024 to 2025, despite it being an election year. The latest data points to further improvement in the fiscal position in the first two months of the current fiscal year. The government’s cumulative fiscal deficit, which stands at 0.8% of the annual target, is at its lowest since April 1997 (when the government began publishing monthly economic data).\n*   **The other big factor has been falling inflation**, which had been easing since the beginning of the fiscal year, but fell to 2.1% in June 2025, marking the lowest levels since January 2019. This came as a big relief for Indian consumers and policymakers, who saw it as an opportunity to aggressively pursue easing monetary policy and cut policy rates by 100 basis points between February and June.\n\n![Image 16](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nIndia is maintaining a steady lead over peer economies\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile one might argue that India’s economic growth moderated in the last fiscal, compared with the exceptional 9.2% growth recorded the year before, the continued resilience of the Indian economy underscores the strength of domestic fundamentals and effective policy support. India has made remarkable progress in its global economic standing, consistently climbing the ranks in terms of growth performance and macroeconomic stability over the past decade (figure 1).\n\nThis is despite persistent shifts in trade and globalization trends, the impact of the pandemic, and geopolitical conflicts in regions accounting for a large share of crude-oil production.\n\n![Image 17](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-1.jpg)\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-1.jpg)[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#)\n\n### Share Infographic\n\n*   [Share](javascript:void(0))\n    *   [linkedin](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"linkedin\")\n    *   [twitter](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"twitter\")\n    *   [facebook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"facebook\")\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n![Image 18](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nIndia has been leading on three economic fundamentals, namely its strong capital market, robust domestic consumer spending, and dynamic, digitally adept workforce.\n\n![Image 19](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nIndian capital markets are getting deeper with strong returns on investment\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIndia saw its share of ups and downs through fiscal year 2024 to 2025: The country witnessed capital outflows for five straight months until March 2025, before turning to modest inflows.[4](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-4) Events such as stimulus announcements in China in September and US election results caused volatility in many emerging markets.[5](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-5) At home, national elections and elevated inflation (until January 2025) amid strong capital outflows tested India’s economic resilience.\n\nYet, India’s capital markets have emerged as a standout performer among emerging and developed economies alike: India’s stock market indices witnessed a sharp turnaround since April 2025 (figure 2).\n\nTo compare capital market performance, data from Morgan Stanley Capital International, for a select few peer nations, were indexed to April 2024. India’s rebound in these indices outpaced most emerging market peers amid global volatility in the recent months (figure 2). This could be attributed to a strong rebound in foreign portfolio investment flows in May and June 2025, particularly into sectors like financial services, telecommunications, and services.[6](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-6)\n\nConsidering the long run, India’s equity market outperformed its peers by a significant margin. When indexed to 2019, India’s capital market returns have grown twice in value (figure 2).\n\n![Image 20](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-2.jpg)\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-2.jpg)[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#)\n\n### Share Infographic\n\n*   [Share](javascript:void(0))\n    *   [linkedin](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"linkedin\")\n    *   [twitter](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"twitter\")\n    *   [facebook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"facebook\")\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n![Image 21](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nAs noted in the [January 2025 economic outlook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook-01-2025.html), India’s capital markets have demonstrated resilience, withstanding downward pressures due to foreign portfolio investment outflows thanks to the strong and growing participation of domestic investors. The sustained resilience of Indian capital markets despite global financial volatility highlights the country’s growing decoupling from external shocks, positioning it as an attractive destination with higher returns for long-term investment among the emerging nations, especially as trade-related uncertainties ease.\n\n![Image 22](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nDomestic consumer spending: A stable and reliable pillar\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of the most compelling indicators investors are closely monitoring is the sustained rise in consumption spending, besides evolving consumer spending patterns. This indicator, in particular, remains the largest driver of economic growth in India, contributing approximately 61.4% to GDP in fiscal year 2024 to 2025.[7](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-7) Notably, urban consumption and a shift in spending preferences toward luxury goods are emerging as key pillars of this momentum, an evolution we highlighted in the [April 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook-04-2024.html) and [August 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook-08-2024.html) editions of this outlook.\n\nIn the near term, easing inflation and proactive monetary policy are expected to further fuel consumption spending. The Reserve Bank of India has implemented a 100-basis-point rate cut over three consecutive policy meetings, aiming to drive credit growth and boost both investment and consumer spending (figure 3).\n\nDespite these cuts, however, India’s inflation-adjusted real interest rates remain among the highest among emerging economies, currently hovering between 1.5% and 2%.[8](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-8) With inflation moderating to 2.1% in June 2025—the lowest since January 2019—the central bank has greater flexibility to support growth by cutting policy rates in case of external shocks or domestic headwinds, compared to other emerging economies.\n\n![Image 23](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-3.jpg)\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-3.jpg)[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#)\n\n### Share Infographic\n\n*   [Share](javascript:void(0))\n    *   [linkedin](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"linkedin\")\n    *   [twitter](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"twitter\")\n    *   [facebook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"facebook\")\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n![Image 24](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nLooking ahead, India is poised for a significant transformation in its consumer landscape. By 2030, the country is expected to add around 75 million middle-income class and 25 million rich and affluent households, with these segments projected to account for 56% of the population.[9](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-9)\n\nThis demographic shift will position India as one of the fastest-growing consumer markets globally. Major Indian cities are set to become primary drivers of consumer spending across the Asia Pacific, even as urban consumption spending growth slows in more advanced economies (figure 4).\n\n![Image 25](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-4.jpg)\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-4.jpg)[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#)\n\n### Share Infographic\n\n*   [Share](javascript:void(0))\n    *   [linkedin](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"linkedin\")\n    *   [twitter](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"twitter\")\n    *   [facebook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"facebook\")\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n![Image 26](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nThis trajectory will be supported by a combination of factors such as a young and growing population, improving trade dynamics, and a rapidly digitizing consumer base.\n\n![Image 27](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nIndia’s workforce edge in a digital economy\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIndia is swiftly transforming its global image, from a hub of low-skilled outsourcing to a powerhouse of tech-driven talent. By harnessing its young, digitally adept population (with over half under the age of 30 and an expected addition of 100 million by 2030),[10](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-10)the country is positioning itself as a leading center for tech-enabled workforces.\n\nIndia, one of the world’s top producers of science, tech, engineering, and mathematics talent, generates approximately 2.5 million graduates annually, far ahead of most developing countries.[11](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-11) According to a study by Stanford University, India is also catching up fast in emerging technology skilling, with a growing focus on artificial intelligence, data science, cloud, and cybersecurity. AI skill penetration is among the highest in India, compared to developed and developing nations, and second only to the United States (figure 5).[12](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-12)\n\nNotably, India’s STEM and AI-skilled workforce has powered the robust growth of its global capability centers (GCCs), now numbered at over 1,700,[13](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-13)hosting research and development, data analytics, product design, and innovation units for Fortune 500 companies. India’s policy support, private sector participation, and ed-tech innovation make it one of the few countries able to skill at scale and speed. Consequently, India’s services exports have increased substantially (from 33% of total exports in fiscal year 2014 to 2015 to 46% in fiscal year 2025 to 2026). This has helped offset the rising goods imports, thereby reducing the current account deficit (as noted earlier).\n\n![Image 28](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-5.jpg)\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-5.jpg)[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#)\n\n### Share Infographic\n\n*   [Share](javascript:void(0))\n    *   [linkedin](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"linkedin\")\n    *   [twitter](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"twitter\")\n    *   [facebook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"facebook\")\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n![Image 29](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nIndia is opening new trade doors\n--------------------------------\n\nAs India carves out a new growth road map—one built on a foundation of high investment returns, robust consumer demand, and an increasingly AI-skilled workforce—it will be enhanced by the country’s maturing trade diplomacy. Recent strategic trade negotiations, notably with the United Kingdom in May and the ongoing talks with the United States,[14](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-14) and the highly anticipated deal with the European Union by the end of the year,[15](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-15) will likely act as powerful multipliers, reinforcing each of these three engines of growth and giving sharper direction to India’s economic momentum over the coming decade.\n\nBilateral trade and investment agreements will offer India a unique advantage by enabling it to craft highly customized partnerships based on mutual strengths. Uncertainty still prevails around the final parameters of the India-United States trade deal, as a 50% tariff is imposed on Indian exports to the United States starting Aug. 27, 2025.[16](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-16)At the time of this writing, India and the United States are working toward a mutually beneficial trade agreement and focusing on key strategic sectors.[17](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-17)\n\nThe potential impact of these trade partnerships will be significant for India. Greater market access could translate into stronger exports, improved incomes, higher employment, and ultimately, a boost to domestic demand. The trade deal also offers a strategic advantage: It is likely to deepen bilateral cooperation in areas such as AI, digital transformation, and innovation-led startups. Strengthened intellectual property frameworks and services provisions will support R&D exports and partnerships, particularly in tech and life sciences.\n\nHowever, much of the outcome from the United States-India trade deal will be clear once it concludes in the coming months and is subsequently implemented. We will detail the specifics in the subsequent outlook report. Till then, Deloitte remains positive about the partnerships as the deals get finalized.\n\n![Image 30](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nIndia’s near-term economic outlook\n----------------------------------\n\nBacked by improving economic fundamentals and a strong policy push to boost consumption spending (through tax exemptions and easing monetary policy),[18](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#endnote-18) we now expect India to grow between 6.4% and 6.7% in fiscal year 2025 to 2026, in our baseline scenario. Easing inflation is expected to further bolster consumer confidence and purchasing power, fueling a surge in spending across sectors. With oil prices expected to remain range-bound, it will likely keep overall inflation low and support an improvement in the current account balance, given oil’s significant share in the import bill. We expect strong domestic demand in the first half of the next year, driven by a significant uptick in private spending, followed by strong private investments as businesses factor in uncertainties. Growth next year will be even stronger, and the momentum over the next two years is set to lift GDP beyond its pre-COVID trend. The pandemic-induced gap will not just be closed, it will be decisively surpassed.\n\nThat said, India’s growth projections in the current fiscal year will likely be tied to broader global trends, including rising geopolitical uncertainties and a delayed synchronous recovery in the West than previously anticipated. Disruptions to global trade and supply chains due to intensifying geopolitical uncertainties will also affect demand for exports.\n\nDomestically, India will have to focus on raising per capita income to ensure a broad-based and consumption-led growth, with a sharper emphasis on employment generation and upskilling. As technology continues to reshape the job market and redefine skill demands, it will be imperative for the government to ensure broader access to AI and digital skills across the workforce of all categories. Only then can the drivers outlined above deliver the momentum needed to propel India’s growth in the future.\n\n![Image 31](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-6.jpg)\n\n[](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/2025/in188469_econ_india-economic-outlook/content-images/IN188469_Figure-6.jpg)[](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html#)\n\n### Share Infographic\n\n*   [Share](javascript:void(0))\n    *   [linkedin](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"linkedin\")\n    *   [twitter](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"twitter\")\n    *   [facebook](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/asia-pacific/india-economic-outlook.html# \"facebook\")\n\n### Or copy link\n\nCopy\n\n### Key assumptions for Deloitte’s projections\n\n![Image 32](https://www.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/icons/svg/icon-alert.svg)\n\nDeloitte’s assumptions can be grouped into two scenario buckets, namely “optimistic” and “pessimistic,” with the former being more likely.\n\n#### Optimistic scenario\n\nTrade policies will likely be clearer by the end of 2025, improving business sentiment globally. Investment decisions will be made, factoring in the continued volatility in trade and disruptions in supply chains. Gradually, the global economy will see a rebound over the next year.\n\nIn India, political stability, policy continuity, fiscal stimulus initiatives, and strong reforms increase economic activity, thereby boosting investor confidence in India’s domestic demand.\n\n*   The US Federal Reserve may go for fewer rate cuts as inflation may rebound.\n*   Economic stimulus programs in China help the country recover in the short run, leading to better trade and investment.\n*   Crude oil prices remain range-bound (Brent prices at around US$65 to US$70 per barrel) due to balanced demand from emerging nations, higher global uncertainties, and a higher supply of crude oil from the United States.\n*   The Reserve Bank of India eases monetary policy twice or thrice this year while maintaining a vigil on unsecured lending. This boosts credit growth and consumer spending.\n*   The interest differential with the Fed’s policy rate attracts global investors to India as trade-related uncertainty is resolved.\n*   The Indian government’s efforts to boost consumer spending drive strong spending and private investment growth, leading to buoyant revenues and higher dividends from public sector undertakings and the Reserve Bank. However, the government ramps up capital expenditures on key infrastructure projects.\n*   The dollar price index appreciates initially but then remains range-bound. This could cause marginal volatility in the Indian rupee, but the country’s central bank is vigilant against fluctuations.\n\n#### Pessimistic scenario\n\nTrade-related uncertainty continues, and there are shocks to supply chains. Regions with ongoing conflicts see prolonged economic uncertainty. Because of political and policy changes, the United States and Europe enter stretches of recession, and investment and trade scenarios worsen. China’s economy slows down, and supply disruptions cause high inflation.

Statistics\n=============================================\n\n[Overview](https://www.ibef.org/economy/indian-economy-overview)\n\n Last updated: Aug, 2025\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nIndia’s economic journey over the past few years has been marked by remarkable growth and a steady rise in its position on the global stage. After overtaking the United Kingdom (UK) to become the fifth largest economy in Q1 FY23, India has continued this upward trajectory to surpass Japan in June 2025 to become the fourth largest economy in the world. With a nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Rs. 3,31,03,000 crore (US$ 3.78 trillion), India’s growth reflects a combination of strong domestic demand and policy reforms positioning the country as a key destination for global capital.\n\nFurther, India is projected to reach a GDP of Rs. 4,26,45,000 crore (US$ 5 trillion) by 2027 and is on course to surpass Germany by 2028. Rising employment and increasing private consumption, supported by rising consumer sentiment, will support GDP growth in the coming months.\n\n![Image 3](https://www.ibef.org/assets/images/indian-economy/Indian-Economy-overview-2.jpg)\n\nMarket Overview\n===============\n\nIndia’s economy shows robust expansion, with real GDP for FY25 estimated at Rs. 1,87,97,000 crore (US$ 2.20 trillion), from Rs. 1,76,51,000 crore (US$ 2.06 trillion) in FY24 with a growth rate of 6.5%. This growth is driven by rising employment and stronger private consumption, supported by improving consumer sentiment, which is expected to keep the momentum going in the near future.\n\nTrade remains a critical pillar of India’s growth story with exports reaching Rs. 37,31,000 crore (US$ 436.6 billion) in FY25, led by Engineering Goods (26.88%), Petroleum Products (13.86%) and Electronic Goods (8.89%). These exports helped the economy stay resilient during the pandemic when other sectors slowed. Union Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Piyush Goyal projects exports to reach Rs. 85,44,000 crore (US$ 1 trillion) by 2030.\n\nIndia’s ability to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has also strengthened. The country received record FDI inflows amounting to Rs. 4,21,929 crore (US$ 49.3 billion) in FY25 a 15% increase over FY24, supported\n\n![Image 4](https://www.ibef.org/assets/images/indias-gross-domestic-products.png)\n_Source: World Bank_\n\nby a stable policy environment, a large domestic market and steady economic growth positioning the country as a key destination for global capital. This capital inflow also complements government plans for increased investment in infrastructure and asset-building projects to further boost economic growth.\n\nIndia’s external economic position is improving. The current account deficit narrowed to Rs. 1,98,726 crore (US$ 23.30 billion), or 0.6% of GDP, in FY25 from Rs. 2,21,754 crore (US$ 26.00 billion), or 0.7% of GDP, in FY24. This improvement was due to higher net receipts from services and secondary income, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nRecent Developments\n===================\n\nIndia is primarily a domestic demand-driven economy, with consumption and investments contributing to 70% of the economic activity. With India’s economy showing resilient growth, supported by strong domestic demand, policy reforms, and a healthy investment pipeline, several new projects and developments are underway across key sectors. This positive development across key sectors is evident from following key economic data points.\n\n*   According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), India's cumulative FDI inflow stood at Rs. 91,45,988 crore (US$ 1.07 trillion) between April 2000-March 2025 with major share coming from Mauritius at Rs. 15,36,849 crore (US$ 180.19 billion) with a total share of 25%, followed by Singapore at 24% with Rs. 14,91,603 crore (US$ 174.88 billion), the United States (US) at 10% with Rs. 6,02,574 crore (US$ 70.65 billion), the Netherlands at 7% with Rs. 4,54,613 crore (US$ 53.3 billion), and Japan at 6% with Rs. 3,78,653 crore (US$ 44.39 billion).\n*   As of July 4, 2025, India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at Rs. 59,68,048 crore (US$ 699.74 billion).\n*   In May 2025, private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments reached Rs. 20,470 crore (US$ 2.4 billion) across 97 deals.\n*   Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) outflows in FY25 were close to Rs. 1,27,000 crore (US$ 14.89 billion), while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) bought in Rs. 6,00,000 crore (US$ 70.34 billion) in the same period.\n*   The HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a 14-month high of 58.4 in June 2025 from 57.6 in May, indicating a strong improvement in manufacturing conditions. Robust domestic and international demand drove sharp increases in output and new orders, while employment saw a record rise as firms expanded their workforce to meet rising workloads. New export orders surged, marking the third-fastest growth since the survey began in 2005. Although input cost inflation eased, producer prices increased as companies passed on higher freight and labour costs to customers.\n*   India saw a robust 10.35% growth in passengers carried by domestic airlines at 431.98 lakh in FY25, from 391.46 lakh in FY24, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).\n*   India secured 39th position out of 133 economies in the Global Innovation Index 2024. India rose from 81st position in 2015 to 39th position in 2024. India ranks third position in the global number of scientific publications.\n*   In FY25, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) recorded its highest-ever gross collection at Rs. 22,08,000 crore (US$ 258 billion), registering a YoY growth of 9.4%. The average monthly collection stood at Rs. 1,84,000 crore (US$ 21.57 billion).\n*   In May 2025, the overall Index of Industrial Production (IIP) stood at 156.6 (base 2011–12 = 100), reflecting a YoY growth of 1.2%. The mining, manufacturing and electricity sectors stood at 136.6, 154.3 and 216, respectively.\n*   According to data released by the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI), India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) - Combined inflation was 3.34% in March 2025 against 4.85% in March 2024.\n*   India’s wheat procurement for FY26 has reached 29.7 million tonnes as of May 22, 2025, the highest in four years and up 13.5% YoY. Strong production of 115.43 million tonnes, favourable weather, and bonuses above the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in key states have driven this growth. The Food Corporation of India expects procurement to hit 32.5 million tonnes by season end, raising stocks to 44 million tonnes, well above the 18.4 million tonnes needed for the Public Distribution System.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n======================\n\nOver the years, the Indian government has introduced many initiatives to strengthen the nation's economy. The Indian government has been effective in developing policies and programmes that are not only beneficial for citizens to improve their financial stability but also for the overall growth of the economy. Over recent decades, India's rapid economic growth has led to a substantial increase in its demand for exports. Besides this, several of the government's flagship programmes, including Make in India, Start-up India, Digital India, the Smart City Mission, and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, is aimed at creating immense opportunities in India.

The team explores investment opportunities in this dynamic economy.\n\n[Download complete PDF](https://franklintempletonprod.widen.net/content/hcrpxnac3v/pdf/india-outlook-2025.pdf)\n\nThe structural growth outlook for India’s economy remains very much intact in our view, with various signs indicating that the slowdown in 2024 will be transitory. We expect the growth momentum to improve entering 2025, as government spending picks up again and consumer sentiment stays resilient. This should enable better earnings growth, amid an improving economic backdrop that may also find support from favorable monetary and fiscal policies.\n\nWe believe India will continue to stand out as the fastest-growing major economy globally in the coming years. In this environment, the premiumization of consumption remains a high-conviction theme for Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity (FTEME). We also stay positive on India’s vibrant digital economy and its beneficiaries, as well as the structural growth potential in the health care sector.\n\n## Temporary slowdown, but recovery in place\n\nIndia’s economic growth slowed in 2024, with gross domestic product (GDP) year-on-year growth of just 5.4% in the fiscal second quarter (July-September), the lowest in seven quarters. As a result, growth for the full fiscal year ending March 2025 will likely be 6.6%,1 moderating from 8.2% from a year earlier, based on Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecasts.\n\nWe believe this slowdown is temporary, with deferred government spending in a general election year the primary cause. Heavy monsoon rainfall during the summer also proved disruptive to economic activities. In our view, several high-frequency datapoints are showing improving underlying conditions for a recovery in growth:\n\n* **Government spending is picking up**: Government cash balance—a major indicator for government spending—dropped to a deficit of INR458 billion (US$5.4 billion) in the first week of December.2 This figure has been on a downtrend since September, suggesting that the government is gradually ramping up its spending on priority initiatives, particularly infrastructure and rural development. Importantly, a pickup in government spending and activities should synergize capital expenditure (capex) growth in the private sector. For instance, we may see faster approvals for construction and engineering projects, bolstering company confidence to invest and hire more actively.\n* **Domestic demand remains healthy**: Private consumption is a major driver for India’s economy and it is showing stronger growth momentum in the second half of this year (Exhibit 1). Consumer sentiment also remains resilient and year-ahead optimism has held firm, indicating a post-election recovery (Exhibit 2). Consumption growth should find further support if inflation cools in 2025. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate will moderate from 5.7% in the October-December quarter of 2024 to 4% in the July-September quarter of 2025, based on RBI forecasts.3\n\nThe resumption of government spending, private sector capex growth and the resilience of domestic consumption, among other factors, may help India’s economy return to normalcy in 2025. As growth accelerates again, the stage is set for earnings recovery.\n\n## Exhibit 1: Private Consumption Growth Gains Momentum\n\nSources: CEIC, Morgan Stanley Research. As of November 17, 2024.\n\n## Exhibit 2: Consumer Sentiment Is Recovering\n\nSources: Reserve Bank of India, Franklin Templeton. As of November 2024.\n\n## Earnings growth recovery and policy factors\n\nIndian equities, as represented by the Nifty 50 benchmark, are likely to see high-single-digit earnings growth in the current financial year ending March 2025, declining from the high-teen level growth seen in the previous financial year. This is due to sharp earnings cuts particularly in the energy, industrials and consumer staples sectors. However, we believe corporate earnings growth will accelerate to a mid-teen level in the next financial year, in line with India’s economic recovery. The current consensus forecast puts Nifty 50 earnings-per-share (EPS) growth at 14.7% for the financial year ending March 2026 (Exhibit 3).\n\n## Exhibit 3: Nifty 50 EPS Growth Appears Poised to Accelerate Again\n\nSources: Bloomberg, Jefferies Equity Research and Strategy. As of December 12, 2024. There is no assurance that any estimate, forecast or projection will be realized.\n\nThe recovery of domestic private consumption and government spending should drive the improvement of India’s economic momentum. These are also key factors that should catalyze a reacceleration in corporate earnings growth.\n\nA third factor that we are monitoring is the tailwind arising from stable inflation and a favorable fiscal policy position. These trends may lead to interest rate cuts in 2025, especially given the moderation of CPI inflation towards the 4% target rate. As for fiscal policies—we note that the government’s focus on lowering fiscal deficit may limit policy flexibility, but additional measures to spur growth recovery in 2025 cannot be ruled out.\n\nWe are monitoring whether the government will table further personal income and corporate tax benefits in its FY26 budget (out in February 2025). Any such announcements will add on to the stimulative policies rolled out in the current financial year. For instance, the FY25 budget includes targeted tax cuts and increased deductions for employees, the value of which is estimated to be US$210 per annum per salaried worker, with a focus on middle-income employees. Meanwhile, an income transfer scheme that offers a minimum monthly income to women in selected states also bears watching. If broadened to more states or even to a national level, this scheme should further strengthen consumption, to the benefit of the overall economy.\n\nWe remain mindful of external headwinds; the tariff hikes US president-elect Donald Trump has proposed represent a key risk to consider. At this stage, we expect the impact of higher US tariffs to be manageable. Among the major Indian exports,4 electrical and electronic equipment—which in 2023 accounted for US$9.89 billion or 13% of total exports to the United States—may take a larger hit. However, this risk is global and not specific to India. Other major US-bound exports, such as precious stones and metals (13.4% of total) and pharmaceutical products (10% of total) face limited competition from other markets. Hence, these products should prove resilient even if they are subject to higher US tariffs, as they have relatively inelastic demand, enabling them to pass through higher costs. Meanwhile, we are cognizant of the possibility that the US tariff hikes may be uneven among countries, with certain countries facing higher levels than others. India may benefit from this differential.\n\n## Long-term growth prospects and high-conviction themes\n\nAs economic and earnings recovery takes shape in 2025, we reiterate our confidence that India’s long-term growth prospects remain strong and firm.\n\nThe country should continue to benefit from the political stability and socioeconomic reforms under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. Broad-based infrastructure and manufacturing investments should remain a priority for the country as it aims to become a vibrant industrialized economy that sits at the heart of global supply chains. These developments have joined domestic consumption to lay a solid foundation for self-sustaining economic growth.\n\nAll in all, we believe India can comfortably maintain its position as the world’s fastest-growing major economy, with GDP growth of around 6.5% until at least 2029 (Exhibit 4). Income growth and the rise of the middle class will likely continue in tandem. We expect India’s wealthy and middle-class populations to expand by 400 million people. In particular, the number of people in India’s wealthiest class could grow three-fold.5\n\n## Exhibit 4: India GDP Growth Leads the Rest of the World\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund, Franklin Templeton. As of December 2024. There is no assurance that any estimate, forecast or projection will be realized.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we maintain a high conviction in themes associated with consumption, digitalization and health care, among other ideas:\n\n* **Consumption and premiumization**: Domestic consumption remains the key to both near-term recovery and long-term prospects of India’s economy. A confluence of macro factors place consumers at the driver’s seat of India’s growth. Favorable demographics—characterized by a larger proportion of younger people—have combined with sustained income growth to spur demand for goods and services, with consumers increasingly willing to fork out for more premium offerings. We see this in the structural increase of discretionary spending (Exhibit 5) as part of Indians’ wallet share, relative to essential products. Notably, the consumer discretionary sector may see compounded annual earnings growth (CAGR) of 17.3% between financial year 2024 and 2026—the highest across all sectors.6\n\n## Exhibit 5: The Structural Growth of Discretionary Spending\n\nSources: CEIC, ICICI Securities. December 12, 2024. **Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future results.**\n\n* **Digitalization and technology**: A conscious policy push for digital transformation forms another key part of India’s growth engine. This is driving multi-year investment opportunities across a broad range of goods and services providers, from online retail and food ordering to information technology (IT) consulting and outsourcing. Workforce growth, government support and infrastructure development support the IT landscape in the country. Investments in artificial intelligence and automation may drive further demand for India’s technology expertise.\n* **Health care**: In our view, the health care sector is also part of India’s consumption growth story, similarly benefiting from rising income levels as well as demand for higher-quality services and lifestyles. We expect to see increased health care spending in India, potentially supporting the expansion of hospital chains and local specialty drug production. In particular, hospital operators are well positioned to capture the structural opportunities stemming from India’s shortage of hospital beds. A low hospital bed density (Exhibit 6) implies considerable untapped demand and a long runway for capacity expansion, which should underpin long-term market growth. In the near term, the health care sector is expected to see earnings CAGR of 16.9% in FY24-26, the second highest among all sectors.7\n\n## Exhibit 6: India’s Hospital Bed Density Relative to 10,000 Population\n\nSources: Global Health Observatory, WHO, CRISIL research, JPMorgan.

These indicators include industrial activity, trade, financial services, economic sentiments and sector-wise trends.\n\n## Brief Summary for Latest Report\n\n**August 2025**\n\n**Key highlights include:**\n\n* High-frequency indicators exhibited mixed trends in Jun-Jul'25 amid global headwinds and trade uncertainties. IIP declined in Jun'25, reflecting weaker mining activity and lower primary goods output. Steel consumption also softened, mainly due to subdued demand for alloy steel. Power consumption remained broadly unchanged in Jul'25 from Jun'25, tempered by higher-than-usual monsoons. The auto sector witnessed contrasting trends across segments in Jul'25. While passenger vehicle (PV) sales rebounded and 2W sales largely remained unchanged, tractor sales recorded a sharp seasonal downturn. In the energy domain, renewable energy generation surged to a new record in Jun'25, driven primarily by wind and small hydro sources.\n* On the trade front, merchandise trade deficit widened to an 8-month high of $27.4 bn in Jul'25, reflecting stronger imports of petroleum products and gold amid ongoing global tariff uncertainties. In contrast, the services trade surplus remained broadly stable at $15.6 bn, although imports contracted at a slightly faster pace than exports. Meanwhile, forex reserves edged lower in Jul'25, primarily due to a decline in foreign currency assets. FDI inflows rebounded in Jun'25 amid a surge in equity investments.\n* BFSI indicators reflected contrasting signals in Jun–Jul'25. Both aggregate credit and deposits continued to inch upwards in Jun'25. UPI transactions rebounded sharply, with volumes touching a record high in Jul'25. Insurance premiums also grew during the month, led by robust growth in the non-life segment. Similarly, mutual fund AUM rose to a new peak, supported by strong inflows into both debt and equity schemes. In contrast, trading activity on the NSE and BSE weakened in Jul'25. The market volatility index (VIX) also slipped further to close at a 22-month low, amid the absence of pronounced market swings.\n* On the macroeconomic front, WPI inflation fell to a 25-month low (−0.6%); CPI inflation eased to a 6-year low of 1.6% in Jul’25, led by softer food & beverage prices. Meanwhile, business activity indicators remained robust. Manufacturing PMI climbed to a 16-month high of 59.1, supported by stronger new orders, output, and inventories. Services PMI also rose to an 11-month high of 60.5, indicating sustained momentum across both sectors. Fiscal and revenue trends were more mixed in this period. GST collections increased in Jul'25, supported by higher gross import revenues. However, India’s fiscal deficit widened sharply in Jun'25, reflecting weaker non-tax revenues and a surge in interest payments. Analysts project FY26 GDP growth at 6.2-7.0%.\n\n[DOWNLOAD THE LATEST REPORT](https://web-assets.bcg.com/dc/6e/4dee2def4173bb0b7082ee951190/india-economic-monitor-aug25.pdf)\n\n## Past
